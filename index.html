    <h4>About this game</h4>

        <div id="gameDescription">
                <p>
                    Letâ€™s run is a single player fun digital game for all ages that allows a player to run endlessly until the
                    course overcomes the player's hand and eye coordination. The game play will consist of an endless trail that
                    will have obstacles and missing parts of the platform, which could either hurt the player or kill them. With
                    this game, reflexes is the key, as the further the player progresses on the trail the harder the game will
                    become. Obstacles such as spikes will appear frequently, platforms will appear at random distances and
                    elevations, while the game play speed will increase. Despite its challenge, the game offers players the
                    convenience to play anywhere in the world and compare scores among other players.
